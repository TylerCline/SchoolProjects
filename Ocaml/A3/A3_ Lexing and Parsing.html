<h2> Lexing and Parsing with ocamllex/Menhir </h2>

<a href="http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/courses/4100-16/hw/grumpy-spec.txt">Grumpy</a> is a small imperative 
programming language. For example:
<pre>  def fact(x : int) : int {
      if x == 0 then 1
      else if x == 1 then 1 
           else x * fact(x - 1)
  }
  fact(4)
</pre>
defines a Grumpy function
<pre>  def fact(x : int) : int { ... }
</pre>
the computes the factorial of <tt>x</tt>.
The final line of the program calls <tt>fact</tt>
on the integer 4, with result 24. You'll notice that function-call 
syntax in Grumpy follows C style rather than OCaml style.

<p>In general, every Grumpy program consists of a number of 
function definitions followed by an expression (which may 
call one or more of the defined functions).
</p><pre>  def f(...) : ... { ... }
  def g(...) : ... { ... }
  ...
  def z(...) : ... { ... }
  ... some result expression here ...
</pre>

<p>
Here's a second example that illustrates a couple additional 
features of Grumpy: mutable references and variable scope:
</p><pre>  def f(x:int, y:bool) : int {   // -+ x and y go into scope
    let z = ref x;               // -+ z goes into scope
    {                            //  |
      let w = !z;                // ---+ w goes into scope
      z := w + 1                 //  | |
    };                           // ---+ w goes out of scope
    !z + 1                       //  |
  }                              // -+ x,y, and z go out of scope
  f(3, false)
</pre>
The code above defines a function <tt>f</tt> that takes an 
<tt>int x</tt> and a <tt>bool y</tt> as arguments and returns
an integer (type <tt>int</tt>). The first line 
(<tt>let z = ref x</tt>) defines a let-bound <strong>mutable 
reference</strong> <tt>z</tt> initialized to x. 

<p>
</p><div class="inset">
Mutable references are similar to regular old mutable variables 
in C or C++ (recall that, in general in OCaml, let-bound variables
are immutable as we saw in Week 1). 
One main difference is that, 
instead of directly reading a mutable variable <tt>z</tt>
(as in <tt>x = z</tt> in C), 
you explicitly dereference it first using the <tt>!</tt> operator,
as in <tt>!z + 1</tt> (this expression evaluates to 1 plus 
whatever value is in memory at address <tt>z</tt>). Another 
way to think of references: <tt>z</tt> is a pointer to a chunk of 
memory initialized to <tt>x</tt>. Dereferencing <tt>!z</tt> is 
like doing <tt>*z</tt> in C. Assignments to <tt>z</tt>, 
as in <tt>z := w + 1</tt>, are like doing <tt>*z = w + 1</tt>.
Unlike C pointers, OCaml references are type-safe (operations on 
references won't go wrong at runtime).
</div>

<p>
The function's second line introduces a new block scope
with brackets <tt>{ ... }</tt>. 
What's the effect of this scope? Any let-bound variables
we declare inside it won't be accessible outside 
the <tt>{ ... }</tt> (for example, it would be illegal 
to refer to <tt>w</tt> in the expression <tt>!z + 1</tt>, 
by rewriting it to something like <tt>!z + w</tt>). 

</p><p>The overall result of the program is 5: Reference 
<tt>z</tt> is initialized to 3. Variable <tt>w</tt> equals 3
in the update to <tt>z := w + 1 (= 3 + 1 = 4)</tt>.
Finally, the result of the function is the last sequenced expression 
in its body, <tt>!z + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5</tt>.

</p><p>
</p><h3>Your job</h3>
in this assignment is to implement a lexer and parser 
for Grumpy, following the language syntax briefly overviewed 
above and specified in BNF in 
the <a href="http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/courses/4100-16/hw/grumpy-spec.txt">Grumpy language specification</a>.
<ul>
<li>To implement the lexer, you'll be using 
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/lexyacc.html">ocamllex</a>, a lexer generator.</li>
<li>To implement the parser, you'll be using 
<a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/">Menhir</a>, a parser generator for LR(1) grammars.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Before doing any actual programming, read through 
all the instructions below.</strong>
 And as always, ask early on Piazza if 
something's unclear!

<h2>1. Download the assignment files</h2>

First, download the <a href="http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/courses/4100-16/hw/a3.tgz">assignment files</a>
and unzip the resulting gzipped tarfile into a new directory.

<pre>$ tar xzvf a3.tgz
</pre>

In the resulting directory <tt>src</tt> you'll find the following file structure:

<pre>  src/               -- compiler source files
    Makefile         -- the project Makefile
    _tags            -- the tags file for ocamlbuild
    AST.mli          -- language-independent abstract syntax stuff
    AST.ml           -- associated helper functions
    exp.mli          -- the definition of Grumpy's abstract syntax
    exp.ml           -- associated functions
    lexer.mll        -- ocamllex source file (Part 2)
    parser.mly       -- Menhir source file (Part 3)
    grumpy.ml        -- the toplevel compiler program    
    tests/           -- test cases
</pre>

To build the project, type 
<pre>$ make
</pre>
At this point, you may see a bunch of warnings of the form
<pre>  ...
  File "parser.mly", line 13, characters 15-20:
  Warning: the token WHILE is unused.
  Finished, 22 targets (0 cached) in 00:00:00.
</pre>
That's OK -- it's just Menhir telling you that the token <tt>WHILE</tt> 
(defined in <tt>parser.mly</tt>), and so on for all the other 
token kinds, is unused. 

<p>
</p><div class="inset">
The build system assumes you have <tt>ocamlbuild</tt>, <tt>ocamlfind</tt>, Batteries, etc.
installed on your machine -- follow the instructions in <a href="http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/courses/4100-16/hw/0.html">A0</a>
if you're still missing one of these packages.
</div>

<p>Now try running
</p><pre>$ make test
</pre>
The tests won't pass yet of course (you haven't yet completed the assignment)
so at this point you'll see a bunch of error messages of the form: 
<pre>  $ make test
  ocamlbuild -use-menhir -use-ocamlfind grumpy.native
  Finished, 22 targets (22 cached) in 00:00:00.
  cd tests &amp;&amp; ./run.sh
  test01-unary-negation.gpy:1:2: Unexpected char: -
  *** test01-unary-negation.gpy FAILED ***
  test02-boolean-negation.gpy:1:2: Unexpected char: n
  *** test02-boolean-negation.gpy FAILED ***
  ... followed by many more ...
</pre>
To run the tests manually, you can do <tt>./run.sh</tt> from 
within the <tt>tests</tt> directory. Within that directory, you'll also 
find a bunch of sample Grumpy programs, for example:
<pre>  ...
  test50-fractal.gpy
  test50-fractal.gpy.expected
  test51-loopref.gpy
  test51-loopref.gpy.expected
</pre>
Each Grumpy source program (extension <tt>.gpy</tt>) is paired 
with a second file (extension <tt>.expected</tt>) that gives 
that program's expected output. You won't use the expected output 
in this assignment (you're just lexing and parsing) but the output
files may be useful for understanding what each program does.

<h2>2. lexer.mll</h2>

Your job in this part is to build a lexer, using ocamllex, that 
converts concrete programs such as the <tt>.gpy</tt> files in the
<tt>tests</tt> directory into lists of tokens for consumption 
by the parser you'll build in Part 3.

<p>
Start by opening <tt>lexer.mll</tt>; now navigate to the 
(mostly empty) definition of 
<tt>rule token</tt>. You'll see that, initially, it contains only 
one rule: 
</p><pre>  rule token = parse
    | _
    { raise (Syntax_err ("Unexpected char: " ^ Lexing.lexeme lexbuf)) }
</pre>
No matter what initial character
the input file contains, <tt>token</tt> initially always
raises a syntax exception "Unexpected char: ...".
The wildcard <tt>"_"</tt> is the catch-all pattern; the 
code within the braces beginning <tt>raise (Syntax_err ...)</tt>
defines the action to perform in this case (raise an exception).

<p> In general, each rule in the definition of <tt>token</tt> 
pairs a regular expression (on the left) with a chunk of OCaml
code (in braces on the right). For example, the following few rules 
</p><pre>  rule token = parse
      "//"               { comment lexbuf }
    | ['0'-'9']+ as lxm  { INTCONST(Int32.of_string lxm) }
    | ...

  and comment = parse
      ...                { ... do something ... }
    | ...                
</pre>
lex comments (the definition of the <tt>comment</tt> rule is elided 
above -- you'll have to implement it) and 
32-bit integer constants. The <tt>comment</tt> rule is defined mutually recursively --
you're free to add as many additional mutually recursive rules as you like.
Note that when <tt>comment</tt> is called, we pass it the special argument
<tt>lexbuf</tt>, which gives the current state of the lexer buffer. 

<p>
In the regexp-style pattern 
</p><pre>  ['0'-'9']+ as lxm
</pre>
<tt>lxm</tt> is bound to whichever strings 
match the regexp <tt>['0'-'9']+</tt> at lex time (that is, nonempty strings 
of characters either 0, 1, ..., 9), and can be used 
within the braces in the right-hand side of the rule. 
For example, <tt>INTCONST(Int32.of_string lxm)</tt> returns
an <tt>INTCONST</tt> token (standing for "integer constant") 
containing the integer interpretation of <tt>lxm</tt>
(<tt>Int32.of_string lxm</tt> converts <tt>lxm</tt> to the 
corresponding 32-bit integer, e.g., <tt>Int32.of_string "45" = 45</tt>).

<p>
</p><div class="inset">
Before beginning to actually code, peruse the <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/lexyacc.html">ocamllex manual</a> to learn more about 
ocamllex and its syntax; or read through <tt>lexer.mll</tt> in the <a href="https://github.com/gstew5/cs4100-public/tree/master/calc-example">calc example</a> I showed in class.
</div>

<p>
The definition of the tokens themselves is given in <tt>parser.mly</tt>.
Here are the first few:
</p><pre>  %token &lt;int32&gt; INTCONST
  %token &lt;float&gt; FLOATCONST
  %token &lt;bool&gt; BOOLCONST
  %token &lt;string&gt; ID

  %token DEF LET WHILE IF THEN ELSE REF INT FLOAT BOOL UNIT TT
</pre>
The first declarations define
token types that contain values of OCaml types. For example,
<tt>%token &lt;string&gt; ID</tt> defines a new token type <tt>ID</tt> 
that contains OCaml strings. 
The last line defines a bunch of token types that contain 
no OCaml data. 

<p>
</p><div class="inset">
<h3>A few hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your lexer is probably not done until you've defined a rule to produce
each possible token. </li>
<li>If your lexer reads <tt>eof</tt>, indicating the end of 
the input buffer, you should return token <tt>EOF</tt>.</li>
<li>You'll note from reading the <a href="http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/courses/4100-16/hw/grumpy-spec.txt">
Grumpy syntax specification</a> that 
the language supports two styles of comments (both single-line and 
nested multiline comments). To support nested multiline comments, 
it may be useful to know that ocamllex rules (such as <tt>token</tt>,
<tt>comment</tt>, etc.) can take additional parameters
besides lexbuf. For example, you might define a new rule 
<pre>  ...
  and nested_comment level = parse
    ...
</pre>
that takes a "nesting level" as its first argument....
</li><li>To debug your lexer, try inserting print statements into 
the <tt>{ ... }</tt> section of each rule. That is, write the 
rule that lexes int constants not as:
<pre>  | ['0'-'9']+ as lxm
  { INTCONST(Int32.of_string lxm) }  
</pre>
but as:
<pre>  | ['0'-'9']+ as lxm
  { print_string "INT(";
    let i = Int32.of_string lxm
    in print_int (Int32.to_int i);
       print_string ")";
       INTCONST(i) }
</pre>
and likewise for the other rules you add (the print debug
statements for tokens that don't contain OCaml values will
be less complicated).
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>3. parser.mly</h2>

Read <tt>AST.mli</tt> and <tt>exp.mli</tt>. 

<p>
</p><div class="inset">
<h3>OCaml Module Interfaces (<tt>.mli</tt> files)</h3>

So far, we've mostly just seen OCaml files ending in <tt>.ml</tt>.
Files with extension <tt>.mli</tt> define <strong>interfaces</strong>
rather than implementations (sort of like <tt>.h</tt> files in C).
They're similar to <tt>.ml</tt> files except that, instead of including
function definitions they include include function types. The declaration
of function types starts with <tt>val</tt> instead of <tt>let</tt>, as in:
<pre>  (** Is type [t] an arithmetic type? *)
  val is_arith_ty : ty -&gt; bool
</pre>
This declaration (and all other such declarations) must be accompanied by
a corresponding function definition in <tt>AST.ml</tt>. 
</div>

<p>
In the assignment code, interface files <tt>AST.mli</tt> and <tt>exp.mli</tt> 
define the abstract syntax of the 
Grumpy source language. The Grumpy lexer and parser convert 
concrete Grumpy programs into values of type 
<tt>(AST.ty, unit Exp.exp) AST.prog</tt>. 

</p><p>
</p><div class="inset">
Part of your job in this 
assignment is to "reverse engineer" this type, from the comments in 
<tt>AST.mli</tt> and <tt>exp.mli</tt>, in order to figure out how to 
build 
(abstract syntax) 
expressions, function definitions, and programs in the "semantic 
actions" sections of your Menhir parser definition (that is, the chunks 
of your parsing rules that sit on the right-hand side of each 
nonterminal rule, within the curly braces). 
</div>

<p>
</p><h3>
Now
</h3> Open <tt>parser.mly</tt> and complete the Menhir definition 
of Grumpy's parser. 

<p>
In general, your job in this file is to add a number of new
nonterminal rules to the Menhir grammar, corresponding to the 
Grumpy syntax given in the <a href="http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/courses/4100-16/hw/grumpy-spec.txt">Grumpy spec</a>.

</p><p>
Each such rule will look something like the following:
</p><pre>  unop:
  | MINUS
    { UMinus }
  | NOT
    { UNot }
  | DEREF
    { UDeref }
</pre>
which defines a new nonterminal called <tt>unop</tt> (unary 
operation) with 
3 productions, one for each unary operation in the language. 
The rule
<pre>  | MINUS
    { UMinus }
</pre>
says that the token <tt>MINUS</tt> is an acceptable unary 
operator; when a <tt>MINUS</tt> is parsed, the rule returns, 
as defined by the code within the braces <tt>{ ... }</tt>,
the abstract syntax <tt>UMinus</tt>. 
The whole abstract syntax of unary and binary operations
(and of identifiers, function definitions, and whole programs) is
given in file <tt>AST.mli</tt>. That file is quite heavily documented;
see it for additional details.

<p>
Menhir rules can be more complicated. Here's a second example:
</p><pre>  exp_list:
  | l = separated_list(COMMA, exp)
    { l }
</pre>
Assuming we've defined a nonterminal rule for expressions, 
called <tt>exp</tt>,
this rule defines a new nonterminal <tt>exp_list</tt> that 
parses lists of expressions separated by <tt>COMMA</tt> tokens.

<p>
In the rule, the result of parsing this list (a list of 
abstract syntax expressions) is bound to 
variable <tt>l</tt>, which may then appear within the braces
<tt>{ ... }</tt>. In this case, our <tt>exp_list</tt> rule just 
returns <tt>l</tt>. However in general, a rule might do more
interesting things with intermediate expressions. For more information
on Menhir's special <tt>separated_list</tt> function (and other 
useful functions), see Section 5.4 of the <a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/manual.pdf">Menhir manual</a>,
which describes Menhir's "Standard Library" (a collection of useful, 
pre-defined parsing functions).

</p><p>Here's one more:
</p><pre>  arg:
  | arg_id = id COLON arg_ty = mytype
    { mk_tid arg_id arg_ty }
</pre>
This rule defines a nonterminal <tt>arg</tt> that parses function parameters
of the form <tt>id COLON ty</tt>, e.g. <tt>x : int</tt>.
It assumes we've already defined rules for the nonterminals <tt>id</tt>
and <tt>mytype</tt>. Within the braces, we return the expression 
<tt>mk_tid arg_id arg_ty</tt>, which constructs the abstract syntax corresponding
to a typed identifier (an identifier together with it's type; see <tt>AST.mli</tt>
for details).

<p>
</p><h3>Precedences and Associativity</h3>
  Your parser should parse arithmetic, boolean, and other operators
  according to the precedence and associativity tables given in the 
  <a href="http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/courses/4100-16/hw/grumpy-spec.txt">Grumpy spec</a>. For example, multiplication
  should bind tighter than addition.

  <p>To encode precedence and associativity in Menhir, add precedence
  and associativity directives to the top of your <tt>parser.mly</tt>
  file (before the <tt>%%</tt>) as documented in Section 4 of 
  the <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/manual.pdf">Menhir manual</a>.

  </p><p> For example, the following pair of directives encode that 
  <tt>TIMES</tt> and <tt>DIV</tt> bind tighter than 
  <tt>PLUS</tt> and <tt>MINUS</tt>:
</p><pre>  %left PLUS MINUS
  %left TIMES DIV
</pre>
  Precedence directives lower in the file (at higher line numbers) 
  have higher priority (bind tighter) than those appearing earlier.
  The <tt>%left</tt> indicates left associativity.

<p>
</p><div class="inset">
<h3>Some hints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You might have trouble defining a nonterminal called <tt>type</tt>.
      Try calling it <tt>mytype</tt> instead.</li>
  <li>Unary operations should bind tighter than binary ones. To encode this, 
      you may find it useful to take advantage of Menhir's <tt>%prec</tt>
      annotations (Section 4.2.1 of the Menhir manual). To best exploit 
      <tt>%prec</tt>, try defining a new precedence
      level associated with no particular 
      nonterminal...<tt>%nonassoc unary_over_binary</tt>.
  </li><li>In <tt>AST.mli</tt>, the abstract syntax for function definitions and 
      whole programs is given via <a href="">record</a> types (think C structs
      with pattern-matching). To get a handle on records, take a look at an 
      online resource like <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/records.html">Chapter 5 of Real World OCaml</a>. 
</li></ul>

<h2>4. Test</h2>
To gain confidence in your definitions, ensure that all test cases pass:
<pre>$ make test
</pre>
We won't grade additional test cases, but you're very welcome to add some if you like.
